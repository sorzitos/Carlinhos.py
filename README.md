## **Behind the project**
**This little project started when me and my friends started a xp war on discord (Wild, I know)**
One of my friends created a "bot" that would send messages using his account on the spam channel so he didnt have to, almost a year after that, I created my own version of it with a little help from my friend [SrLavor](https://github.com/SrLavor).

## **Installation**
    git clone https://github.com/sorzitos/Carlinhos.py
Or alternatively, you can just download it from source.

# PLEASE keep in mind this was made for fun's sake, if you use on a raid or something that's entirely your responsability.
